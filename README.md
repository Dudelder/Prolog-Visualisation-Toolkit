Prolog Trace Visualisation Toolkit
==================================
Welcome to the Prolog Visualisation Toolkit. This project exists out of frustration at the lack of such tools available to both understand and debug Prolog code that I am reading and writing for a module at [Hull University](//hull.ac.uk/). This project aims to act as a place in which I (and hopefully you too!) can write tools to visualise Prolog code in order to gain a better understanding as to how it works. 

For now, this repository contains a web based tool that given a Prolog trace (examples are in the `test_traces` folder), produces a diagram that represents that trace. The next step will be to animate the diagram.

Getting Started
---------------
Currently the latest working version of this code is hosted on [GitHub Pages](//pages.github.com/). You can find it [here](http://sbrl.github.io/Prolog-Visualisation-Toolkit/index.html).

Contributing
------------
If you want to help out, there are several things you can do:

 - Open an issue if you find a trace that breaks the diagram.
 - Fork this repository and play around with the code. Remember to commit to the `master` branch and not the `gh-pages` branch!

Notes
-----
This tool uses the following libraries:

 - [Mermaid: A Diagram rendering tool](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid/), ([Live editor](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/live_editor/), [Docs](http://knsv.github.io/mermaid/))
